# Machine Learning Problems of Everyday

The idea of this respository is to be a place where we can practice a lot of different problemas related to Data Science, in order to create proficiency during solving different kind of problems.

The inspiration cames from a Rust:crab: CLI, called Rustling, that makes really easy to practice Rust basic concepts.

For me, is very clear that we become really good on something if we practice and use with consistency. Otherwise, is very difficult to remember and apply with productivity.

For now, this will not be a CLI, as I'll go navegating through this process, I'll be evaluating what works best to this kind of practice for the Data Science field, that is a lot broad than a scope of a language.

## The first version

In this initial step, I'll be creating notebooks with those exercises regarding a specific topic and the solution needs to occur using just `.py` files.

Here I'll be not prioritizing to fix theory concepts, I'm suposing that those concepts are well stabilish. Probably I'll be putting some concepts on those notebooks.
