# Machine Learning Problems of Everyday

For me, is very clear that we become really good on something if we practice and use with consistency. Otherwise, is very difficult to remember and apply with productivity.

This repo will be used as a place to answer questions from the Personal Q&A app. Besides that, I'm using also as a place to test/run codes from different tutorials from the internet.

# The structure of this repo

- `data`: all databases I'll use.
- `exercises`: the place to write code that answer those questions.
- `notebooks`: running notebooks about a lot of different things.
- `src`: running different codes, mostly to replicate tutorials.
